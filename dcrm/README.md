# Customer Relationship management üìù

**CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**  is a technology for managing all your company‚Äôs relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.

I built this project with Django, MySQL and bootstrap. In this project, We'll be able to Register, Log In, Log Out, Add Records, View Records, Update Records, and Delete Records.
